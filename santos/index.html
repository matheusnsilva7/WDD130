        <h2>The history of Santos</h2>
        <p>
          The history of Santos Futebol Clube goes from the football club's
          founding in 1912 and up to current time. Santos FC, also known simply
          as "Santos" and familiarly as "Peixe", is based in Santos, São Paulo,
          Brazil. The team was founded on April 14, 1912, by the initiative of
          three sports enthusiasts from Santos: Raimundo Marques, Mário Ferraz
          de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza Júnior. In 1962, the club
          participated in their first of many South American competitions, and
          has since amassed seven CONMEBOL trophies and a quadruple. In 1971,
          Santos co-founded the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top-tier in
          Brazil football, along with a string of other clubs.

          After 50 years Santos began to be seen as the best team in the world.
          When Pelé made his debut in the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team
          was already twice state champion (1955/56). The King had as fellow
          players Zito, Pagão, Formiga, Hélvio, Jair da Rosa Pinto, Urubatão,
          Tite and Pepe. Santos won the third state title in 50 years, the
          magical year of 1958 – in which Brazil won the World Cup in Sweden,
          with Zito Santos, Pelé and Pepe, and won in spectacular fashion.
          Santos scored 143 goals in 38 games, averaging 3.76 per game, and
          conceded only 40 goals. Pelé set a record that has never been equaled
          in any state competition in the country: he scored no less than 58
          goals. Santos' traditional rivals were heavily beaten in 1958,
          particularly a 10–0 win against the Nacional. In addition to state
          titles, Santos won the Rio-São Paulo in 1959, beating Vasco in the
          final by 3–0 with two goals by Coutinho, who was only 16 years old.
          Coutinho also scored five goals against Ponte Preta, and Santos won
          the game by 12–1 even without Pelé.
